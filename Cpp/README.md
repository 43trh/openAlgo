This section contains C++ source files for compilation.    
To the extent possible, code that is standards-compliant C++ has been used.

In the event processor or compiler dependent features are needed effort will be made to make that obvious.

> **Note:** Additional C++ code exists within the [Matlab MEX](https://github.com/mtompkins/openAlgo/tree/master/Matlab/MEX/Cpp) section. While the code in this area is designed to be used directly with Matlab, you are encouraged to examine the codebase as it may  easily be converted to standard C++ functions and methods.
