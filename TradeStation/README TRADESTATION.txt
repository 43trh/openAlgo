This section will contain files coded with TradeStation's EasyLanguage.

Although there may be ELD files available from time to time in the depository, the preferred method 
of posting EasyLanguage content is through text file so that EasyLanguage code may be easily seen and 
freely distributed.  

While this approach does create a higher likelihood of a failure to post a referenced called function
that is not of a common nature, I believe the value of publically viewable code to be considerably 
more in line with the spirit of openAlgo.
