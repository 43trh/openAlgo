This section will contain files coded with TradeStation's EasyLanguage.

Although there may be ELD files available from time to time in the repository, the preferred method 
of posting EasyLanguage content is through text file so that code may be easily seen and freely distributed.  

While this approach does create a higher likelihood of a possible failure to post a referenced function that is not standard, I believe the value of publicly viewable code to be considerably more in line with the spirit of openAlgo.org.

In addition, having moved away from TradeStation to MultiCharts those interested may be better served looking within the [MultiCharts](https://github.com/mtompkins/openAlgo/tree/master/MultiCharts) folder for EasyLanguage compatible code.
