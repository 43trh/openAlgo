/************************************ Van Tharp Expectancy formula ********************
{ MultiCharts Custom Criteria: Van Tharp expectancy and SQN. Created for optimise function in MC, testing fine on MC 9.0
(PW*AW)-(PL*AL) generates expectancy, further (PW*AW)-(PL*AL)/stddev would derive SQN. 
However I am only looking at expectancy in this formula.
This iteration uses StrategyPerformance.NetProfit / StrategyPerformance.TotalTrades instead of StrategyPerformance.TotalTrades, as this is how MC calculates
average winning trade. Even though they use LosingTrades to calculate the avergae loser.}


// (PW * AW) - (PL * AL) / AL
//if (StrategyPerformance.TotalTrades!= 0){
if (StrategyPerformance.WinningTrades != 0 && StrategyPerformance.LosingTrades != 0) {

var PW = (StrategyPerformance.PercentProfitable / 100);
var AW = (StrategyPerformance.NetProfit / StrategyPerformance.TotalTrades);
var PL = (1-PW);
var AL = (StrategyPerformance.GrossLoss / StrategyPerformance.LosingTrades);

var LossAvg = PL * AL ;
var WinAvg = PW * AW ;

return (LossAvg + WinAvg) / AL;
}
