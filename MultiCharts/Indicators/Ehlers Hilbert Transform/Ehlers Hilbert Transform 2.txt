{In my first article, using the Hilbert Transform, I showed how the technique
 could be used for measuring the cyclic content in prices at any given bar on
 your chart. This, in turn, I used to create an indicator showing you what the
 cyclic content was and, inferentially, whether you were in a cycle or
 trending pricing mode.  I also included a signal-to-noise ratio computation
 so you could estimate whether there existed enough signal in the pricing
 activity to justify trading on the cycle content. Since the article was
 published, I've come up with a simpler expression for achieving the same
 result and with slightly less delay. The revised TradeStation code is:}

 Inputs: Price((H+L)/2);

 Vars:   InPhase(0),
         Quadrature(0);

 If CurrentBar > 5 then begin

         Value1 = Price - Price[6];
         Value2 =Value1[3];
         Value3 =.75*(Value1 - Value1[6]) + .25*(Value1[2] - Value1[4]);         
         InPhase = .33*Value2 + .67*InPhase[1];
         Quadrature = .2*Value3 + .8*Quadrature[1]; 

         Plot1(Inphase, "I");
         Plot2(Quadrature, "Q");

 end;
