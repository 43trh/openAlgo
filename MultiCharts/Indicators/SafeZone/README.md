## Indicator description: ##
This indicator calculates "The SafeZone Stop" as described by Alexander Elder in his book 
"Come Into My Trading Room", copyright 2002.  The stop indicator is calculated at the beginning of each day based upon the number of days defined in the 'Length' input and the coefficient defined in the 'Multiplier' input.  See the book for more details on the derivation of this stop loss technique.
