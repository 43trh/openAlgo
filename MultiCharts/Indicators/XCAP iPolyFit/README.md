# XCAP iPolyFit #
## Indicator description: ##

This indicator provides as output the least square best fit to a set of polynomials of maximum power (degree) using discrete Legendre polynomials.  This is accomplished by decomposing the time series into discrete Legendre polynomials over the interval of orthogonality given by 2 * Width + 1 and discarding the polynomial fits degrees above some maximum degree.
