# Ichimoku Kinko Hyo #
## Indicator description: ##

The names of mathematicians and statisticians dominate the list of technical analysis innovators; 
it's not often we see newspaper writers on this list, but Tokyo newspaper writer Goichi Hosoda is an exception to the rule. In the years before World War II, Hosoda--with the help of several assistants--developed the Ichimoku Kinko Hyo, or "equilibrium-chart-at-a-glance technique." 

Released in 1968, the technique was designed to illustrate where prices were likely to go and when to trade. 

## Constructing an Ichimoku Chart ##

First, look at the Ichimoku chart so as to have a visual point of reference. The Ichimoku chart consists of three lines, which are color-coded on the chart below, and a "cloud":

Let's see what these lines represent, and how they are plotted:

**Tenkan-Sen**, or conversion line (red) 
	
	(Highest high + lowest low) / 2 calculated over the past seven to eight time periods.


**Kijun-Sen**, or base line (maroon)

	(Highest high + lowest low) / 2 calculated over the past 22 time periods.


**Chikou Span**, or lagging span (pink)

	The most current closing price plotted 22 time periods behind (optional).


**Senkou Span A** (green)

	(Tenkan-Sen + Kijun-Sen) / 2, plotted 26 time periods ahead.


**Senkou Span B** (blue)

	(Highest high + lowest low) / 2, calculated over the past 44 time periods. Plot 22 periods ahead.

The "cloud," known as the **Kumo**, is the space between Senkou Span A and Senkou Span B. 
The time period is most often measured in days; however, this can be modified to be any time unit as long 
as it is consistent throughout all calculations. We should note that, due to the shortened trading week 
(which used to be six days long), the time period values shown here are revised versions of the ones 
that Hosoda used in 1968. 

 
## Interpreting the Chart ##
Now that we have a chaotic chart filled with colorful lines and strange clouds, we need to know how to interpret it. The Ichimoku chart can be used to determine a variety of things. 

Here is a list of signals and how you can spot them:

- **Strong signals**
	- A strong buy signal occurs when the Tenkan-Sen crosses above the Kijun-Sen from below. 
	- A strong sell signal occurs when the opposite occurs. The signals must be above the Kumo.
- **Normal signals**
	- A normal buy signal occurs when the Tenkan-Sen crosses above the Kijun-Sen from below.
	- A normal sell signal occurs when the opposite occurs. The signals must be within the Kumo.
- **Weak signals**
	- A weak buy signal occurs when the Tenkan-Sen crosses above the Kijun-Sen from below.
	- A weak sell signal occurs when the opposite occurs. The signals must be below the Kumo.
- **Overall strength**
	- Strength is shown to be with the sellers if the Chikou Span is below the current price.
	- Strength is shown to be with the buyers when the opposite is true.
- **Support/resistance levels**
	- Support and resistance levels are represented by the presence of the Kumo. 
	- If the price is entering the Kumo from below, then the price is at a resistance level. 
	- If the price is falling into the Kumo, then there is a support level.
- **Trends** 
	- Trends can be determined by simply looking at where the current price is in relation to the Kumo.
	- If the price stays below the Kumo, then there is a downward trend (bearish).
	- If the price stays above the Kumo, then there is an upward trend (bullish).

The Ichimoku charts give us a rare opportunity to predict market timing, support/resistance levels, 
and even false breakouts, all in one easy-to-use technique.
