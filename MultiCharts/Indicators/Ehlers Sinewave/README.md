# Ehler's Sinewave #
## Indicator description: ##

This indicator tries to determine the current phase of the cycles you are in.
 
A sinewave indicator has an advantage over other oscillators such as RSI and Stochastic because it predicts rather than waits for confirmation. This assumes that the measured phase has existed at least briefly in the past and will continue at least briefly into the future. The phase languishes when the market is in a trend mode, and can even have a negative rate of change. This indicator gives entry and exit signals 1/16th of a cycle period in advance of the cycle turning point and seldom gives false whipsaw signals when the market is in a trend mode.
