# BB Squeeze #
## Indicator description: ##

The Bollinger band squeeze indicator gives you a signal before a big momentum move takes place. 
This seems difficult to do, but there is a setup that can help you do this. The setup uses 
Bollinger Bands (20,2), the Keltner Channel (20,1.5) and the 12 period Momentum Oscillator to 
predict a momentum move. This setup, called 'The Squeeze', is described in chapter 10 of 
'Mastering the Trade' by John Carter. When Bollinger Bands and the Keltner Chanel are narrow, 
it indicates a period of rest or consolidation. Usually, the Keltner Channel lies within the 
Bollinger Bands, but when the Bollinger Bands are within the Keltner Channel, it indicates a 
period of extreme consolidation. When the Bollinger Bands breakout of the Keltner Channel, 
it usually signals a powerful move is about to take place. The direction of the move depends on 
the direction of the Momentum Oscillator. If the Momentum Oscillator is above zero, then the 
breakout is a long signal. If the Oscillator is below zero, then it's a short signal.
