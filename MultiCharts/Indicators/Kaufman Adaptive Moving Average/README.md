# Kaufman Adaptive Moving Average #
## Indicator description: ##

Perry Kaufman introduced the Adaptive Moving Average in his book Smarter Trading.

Kaufmanâ€™s indicator uses a ratio that compares price direction with the level of volatility.

This Adaptive Moving Average is designed to address the problem of choosing between a fast or slow moving average.  The speed of the Adaptive Moving Average automatically adapts itself to the level of market volatility.

The Adaptive Moving Average moves slower in a sideways market and faster in a trending market.
